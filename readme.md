# What
This repo contains solved exercises for the book "introduction to algorithms" by Cormen et.al. The exercises solutions consist of psuedo-code implementations of various algorithms. All the implementations will be written in <code>Python 3.7.4</code>. 

Future extensions might include translation into other languages or paradigm implementations of the solutions to the exercises.

# When

This repo will be updated continusly, as I am currently going through the last year of my M.A. programme in Economics and do not have a lot of spare time for self-education. That said, it is my goal to complete the books exercises in time for graduation (i.e. within 6 months).

# Why

Besides serving as a practice for myself to understand more fundamental concepts within computer science, this repo is also made for those with a similar desire to learn via focused self-taught practice. Essentially, this repo should provide you with solutions to exercises in every chapter, in Python; hopefully, this will make the implemntation of these algorithms more clear (Python is quite read:able after all).

If you have any suggestions for possible extensions, feel free to create a pull request o fthe 

# How

Each chapter's correpsonding exercises will be given their own directory, in which the solutions will either be composed within the same script, or spread out.
